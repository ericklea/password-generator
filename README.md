#Title
password-generator

#Description
This application is a random password generator. 
This application provides the user a randomized, password, through the users confirmation of a set of inputs 
To build this application, I utilized javascript. I built this application off of javascript starter code, with complimentary html and css code, provided to me by The University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. 
Building this application, I faced challenges with setting the if statements correctly and seeting the for loop correctly.

#Credits
For this project, I utilized starter code provided by the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp, including html, css, and javascript files. Additionally, I utilized javascript code provided by in class assignments from The Univversity of Utah Coding Bootcamp. Additionally, I utilized ideas from javascript code from https://w3schools.com, https://stackoverflow.com and https://youtube.com. Additionally, I received help on building this application from University of Utah Coding Bootcamp tutor Alistair Rowden and TA Taylor Hakes.
